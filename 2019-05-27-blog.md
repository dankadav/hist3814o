# Module 2 Blog

This week did not go nearly as smoothly as last week did. I encountered many challenges with the exercises. I completed the first 3 with minimal difficulty, but I was not able to fully complete the last 3. The readings this week were quite interesting, and I enjoyed learning about how we access knowledge and how we digitize it. I was particularly interested in the process explored in exercise 3.

## Activities

### Exercise 1

The record of my searches in the 2 databases can be found in the file searchrecords.md. To give a brief summary here: In the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg, I searched "artifex" and "agricola". In the CWGC, I searched "Davidovic" and found a Czechoslovakian soldier named Ludvik Davidovic, to whom I have no relation. In the Nano file, I forgot to put a space between the "#" and my header title but after uploading it I noticed this error and it was an easy fix. The only real difficulty I encountered was not understanding what I was meant to write about my experience using the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg. I asked this in Slack and Dr. Graham provided helpful guidance.

### Exercise 2

I encountered no problems doing Exercise 2. Doing Ian Milligan's tutorial was straightforward, and I saved my commands in the file wgetdownload.md. The second part of the exercise was also easy to follow, and I saved those commands in wardiariesdownload.md. This second file also has the commands from wgetdownload.md at the beginning, because I didn't know how to clear my history. Only after I saved my history did I see alexeitipenko’s comment saying that the command "history -c" can clear it, so I will keep that in mind for the future.

### Exercise 3

I really enjoyed this exercise, and I'm definitely keeping in mind that this is an acceptable Capstone submission. The exercise did trip me up a bit, but I managed to figure it out. My first impression of the Recovered Histories Website is that it is a trustworthy source. It provides an in-depth look at issues surrounding slavery and presents works by a variety of authors with different backgrounds and opinions on the matter. Also, the site offers additional services, like background information and glossaries, and lists its project partners, which all add to its trustworthiness. 

When I opened the .txt file, it opened in TextEdit. This text editor hasn't be mentioned so far in this course, so I wasn't sure if it was any good, but I gave it a try and I think it works just fine. The transcription process went smoothly, but at step 1 of encoding my transcription, I got confused. I misunderstood the instructions as requiring me to highlight my text like I would with a highlighter on paper. With TextEdit, I could only highlight this way if I converted the .txt file to a rich text file. So instead, I decided to download Sublime Text and see if it had this function, and it did not. After some Googling, I found out that highlighting isn't really something plain text editors do, so I turned to Slack to see if anyone knew what we were supposed to do. Dr. Graham explained that the instructions are just telling us to mark up the text, and I was able to keep going. 

The rest of the encoding went smoothly. Once I had finished, I had to figure out how to convert the .txt document to .xml. There was no Save As option, but there was an arrow at the top of the window beside the file name which gave me the option to rename the file. I wasn't sure if it also allowed me to convert it, but I decided to erase the .txt part of the name and write .xml. When I did this, I got a pop-up in Finder asking if I wanted to convert the file, so I clicked OK and it worked. I put the .xml and .xsl documents on my desktop, opened the .xml in Firefox, and got an error message. It showed me the problem sentence so I went back to TextEdit and realized I had forgotten an equals sign. I fixed it, saved it, and retried. I got this error a few more times again, and it was because I had copied and pasted that same line missing the equals sign a few times throughout the text. After fixing these problems, I was only getting plain text in Firefox. I carefully read every line and found no errors. My text hadn't automatically lined up with the indent of the ```<body>``` tag (it was all left aligned, with the exception of the first line), so I thought maybe that was the problem and indented every line. This only created big spaces in my sentences and caused another error message to pop up. I then tried just indenting the ```<p>``` lines so they were all aligned with the ```<body>``` tag but this didn't change anything. Finally, I reread the instructions and realized the .xsl file was titled 000style.xsl but the one I was using was SG_transformer.xsl. I switched them out and it worked!
  
In my .xml file, the SG_transformer.xsl might look for the tags which describe the title, author, etc., as well as the named people and locations, but I don't think it would look for the argument tags. I think it would change my markup by putting all the text into a big block, each bit separated by a comma. Also, in order to get my .xml file to point to this stylesheet, I’d have to change the line that says that a student transcribed the writing so that it says my name and gives a little extra information, like the transcription date.

### Exercise 4

I was not able to get through all of this exercise. I managed to do all of step 1, though I opted not to do the Going Further part because by the time I finished it, I was very frustrated and wanted to just keep moving forward. To alter the notebook, I focused on changing the parameters. I tried to do 'proxtext': 'archeology' 'public', but this just resulted in the dictionary reading "proxtext: archeologypublic". I then tried to put an ampersand, and then a comma, in between archeology and public but these both produced error messages. Following this, I tried to hit enter after 'proxtext': 'archeology' to create a list of other "proxtext" values, but this didn't work either. I decided to Google Python a little bit and learned that I was actually on the right track with this list, but that the values couldn't all by connected to "proxtext" and I need commas after each list item. So I had 'proxtext': 'archeology', (enter) 'year': '19th century', (enter) 'place': 'United States', (enter) 'who': 'public'. This produced the desired results.

For step 2, I found the Open Context API website extremely confusing. I chose to focus on the Bade Museum project. First, I tried to change 'proxtext': 'roman' to 'project': 'bade museum' but after I followed some of the "id" URLs in the search results, which didn't lead me to exclusively Bade Museum results, I didn't think it worked. However, I wasn't really sure what the "id" URLs were or represented so I don't know if I was interpreting this correctly. I then reread the website and thought adding "prop=bade+museum" to the URL in line 2 of the code, in between "search/" and "/.json?", might be the answer. This produced an error. I then tried other combinations, such as "search/prop=bade-museum/.json?" and "search/prop=bade+museum.json?" but these didn't work either. I decided to put it aside and move to step 3. In step 3, I was even more confused, and I was beginning to feel very overwhelmed. I didn't know what I was looking at, even after reading it very carefully. However, I did notice that "prop=" was in the URL, and I noted that it was positioned after the ".json?" part. I went back to step 2 and tried again to alter the URL, and this time the code worked, but Bade Museum was applied as a descriptive filter, so I didn't get the results I wanted. This was very frustrating, and I thought it best to leave Exercise 4 for the time being and get a change of pace.

By the time I took this break, it was late Sunday. I work a 9-5 job so I had a limited amount of time left to finish as much of the exercises as possible and do the blog post, so I was not able to get back to this exercise like I intended.

### Exercise 5

I decided to skip this exercise temporarily (did not turn out to be temporary, unfortunately) because I didn't want to make a Twitter account but when I skipped to step 2, it didn't seem like I could do anything without information from the Twitter account.

### Exercise 6

This exercise was really interesting to me, but I was not able to complete it because I ran out of time before the Monday at midnight submission deadline, as I still had my blog to write. I did complete the first part, though. In an annotation on step 3, Dr. Graham said to use pip instead of sudo when installing Tesseract. For some reason, using pip returned the message that I was using an unknown command. So, I tried sudo and it worked. I then installed ImageMagick but I got some error messages at the end of installation. It looked like some parts of it hadn't installed properly but I thought this might be normal so I kept going. However, converting the first file with TIFF didn't work. I looked back through Slack to see if anyone had discussed this problem, and Jeffrey had given some advice on how to solve it, so I followed his suggestion, which was to do "sudo apt-get update" and then install ImageMagick again. This time it installed properly and the conversion worked. My command history can be seen in the file module2exercise6.md. The command to extract text from the converted file produced the file output.txt.txt, which was bizarre, but it still opened in TextEdit so it doesn't seem to be a problem.

I tried to continue with the next part of exercise 6 but RStudio was coming up blank for me. I turned to Slack to see if anyone knew what was going on, and Dr. Graham explained that this problem was due to a browser issue. By the time I saw this message after work, it was too late for me to continue with the exercises because I needed to begin writing my blog. But, I did take a second to try opening DHBox in Chrome (it was in Firefox when it was blank) and RStudio is working perfectly. If I am able to find some down time in the last few weeks of this course, I do intend to do some practice work on this because I am really interested in learning how to turn an image into text.

### Practice

Please refer to files dhboxwork-2019-05-25.md, moredhboxwork-2019-05-25.md, and practiceproblems.md if you would like to see some of my practice with pushing a file to GitHub from DHBox. I was not able to do this successfully, but after three attempts, I decided to move on. I don't know why it didn't work, but I will continue to give it a shot when I have time. I decided to do this practice after I put out a question in Slack asking if anyone knew how to wrap text in Nano, because meta+L was not working for me. Maggie Sherwin responded that escape+shift+4 was the answer and I made a file to test this. I then decided to try to push this test file to GitHub, producing these practice files as a result.

## Annotations

I chose to do my official annotations on "Building a Volunteer Community: Results and Findings from Transcribe Bentham" by Causer and Wallace. However, I only got to the bottom of the page and read that we were to pick one text to annotate _after_ I had read and annotated the links above. I will remember to read the instructions first before I start in the future.

### Annotation 1

While reading about how the Transcribe Bentham creators tried to encourage the social networking side of the website through creating incentives for advancement, I reflected on how much this resembled phone games, in this [annotation](https://hyp.is/_d70Bn5BEem-mzskSCoO-A/www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/000125.html). I thought this was an interesting and unique way to go about this, because it made it an almost addictive project. Much like a person would constantly play a game to maintain their high ranking, a transcription volunteer might spend all of their downtime transcribing to complete as many texts as quickly as possible. This is an interesting way to think about open collaboration. I suppose it's one thing to open your notes to others and allow them to comment if they wish, and it's another to run an open collaboration project. That demands work from people who aren't being paid for it, and they have to do it during their downtime. There has to be something more than "you get to be a part of something cool/important/different!" to make people want to do this, even in a purely academic setting.

Katie25 added onto my thought by pointing out that this is not an unusual technique. She provides the example of the Tims Rewards Card to point out that this incentivizing is something we all constantly encounter in our everyday lives. I hadn't realized this, so her comment really brought to light how important it was for Transcribe Bentham to work this way, and how important it would be for other open collaboration projects to follow similar guidelines.

### Annotation 2

In this second [annotation](https://hyp.is/NVeXFn6JEemceBvYXnCy3A/www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/000125.html) I wondered about a second aspect of open collaboration. Who regulates everything that people bring together for a project, and makes sure it's all credible? To expand on it here, how can the main editor(s) be sure that a contribution comes from a reliable source? In the case of Transcribe Bentham, I imagine it takes a lot of work and time and resources for the staff to monitor the transcriptions and make sure that everything's right, since the work is mostly not coming from trained professionals. In an academic environment, this would certainly be a much smaller risk, but it's not as though academics haven't been outed for manipulating their sources, for example. At least, though, if the person who is providing open notes is using software with version control, they can demonstrate that they are not to blame, should some sort of controversy arise.

### Annotation 3

This [third](https://hyp.is/fyFvhH3GEemHzXvZI88j1Q/www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/50034/REP127_05_Underwood.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y) annotation of mine reflects how much further I have to come until I can fully employ digital history in my studies/future career. I find it interesting that, though I can list some very significant pros to adopting digital history practices, and I do fully believe that it's a good thing, I find myself set in my non-digital ways. There have been many instances throughout my studies, and also my everyday life, where I haven't trusted a computer to do something properly for me. To give an example of something basic, I find it hard to trust that my phone's calendar won't glitch or mess up somehow and forget to send me an important reminder at some point. So, I leave myself notes in addition to setting reminders. I do realize how ridiculous this is, since I could easily not see the sticky note I left myself, and I am definitely trying to get more comfortable with letting technology do things for me. The same lack of trust applies to my studies, like if I don't believe that ctrl+f has found every instance of a keyword I'm looking for in an article, for example. I know, though, that I will eventually be profitting off of letting technology do things for me, like xvictoriajordan describes in her reply. 

## Reflection Questions

### Have you ever sat down with one of the librarians to get help finding something? Consider the knowledge and labour involved not just with finding materials, but in making materials findable in the first place.

I can imagine that _a lot_ has to happen to make materials findable. Certainly this involves a lot of physical labour, to make sure that bookshelves are in order and organized. Librarians also have to make sure that physical material is properly tracked in the library's database, so that they can keep track of where everything is. Material also needs to be digitized effectively and efficiently, which is a time-consuming process, espcially if done well. Scanning documents and uploading PDFs is different than what we did in exercise 3, because techniques such as were explored in the exercise make material even more findable. They make it easier for people to rule out a source or identify it as relevant to their argument. When there is more information provided, such as tags to highlight people's names, it is easier to find information that is useful. Though not the job of librarians, translation is also another important aspect of making material findable and accessible. This is even more important with dead languages. The Aeneid would be of no use to most people if it hadn't been translated into English.

The knowledge involved in being able to think of a specific book that might be useful to someone's topic, or a small section of a several-storey library that would be good to explore, is very specialized. It is impressive that a librarian can offer this kind of assistance, and certainly takes years of becoming acquainted with their library. It doesn't come as a surprise that the Carleton library has different specialized librarians for different subjects. With such a variety of information, and so much of it, it would be hard for one person to remember it all.

## Comments/Concerns

Last week I was having trouble with DHBox while using Chrome, and Dr. Graham suggested that I try Firefox instead. This week I did, and I had the same issues, though I was able to finally learn that the reason my DHBox keeps seemingly freezing is because I am logged out after 60 seconds of inactivity. I think I will stick to Chrome from now on because switching to Firefox didn't end up fixing anything, but it did add an extra problem, which was that RStudio didn't work. Now that I know the problem, I will just have to make sure I stay very active while I'm working on exercises and only take breaks in between them.

I am concerned that my GitHub is starting to look a little messy. I would like to organize the material I am uploading/creating into folders, by module, if this is possible. So far I haven't located a create folder option but I haven't turned to any GitHub help manuals/pages yet so hopefully I'll discover a way to do this.

I find it difficult to balance the readings and the exercises, to make sure I have enough time to really explore the exercises and leave them and come back to them with a clear head. In Module 3, I will be trying to spend less time on the readings so that I can dedicate more time to exercise problem-solving. Hopefully it makes a difference.
