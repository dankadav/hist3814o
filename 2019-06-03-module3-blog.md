## Annotations

I chose to do my official annotations on David J. Birnbaum's "What is XML and why should humanists care? An even gentler introduction to XML". This article explained XML really well and clearly and I feel much more confident in my understanding of it now. 

All of my annotations for this article start with a note identifying which sentence I am intending to annotate to make sure there is no confusion, because the website kept showing sentences other than the ones I was highlighting.
