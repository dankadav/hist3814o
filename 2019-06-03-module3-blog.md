## Annotations

I chose to do my official annotations on David J. Birnbaum's "What is XML and why should humanists care? An even gentler introduction to XML". This article explained XML really well and clearly and I feel much more confident in my understanding of it now. 

All of my annotations for this article start with a note identifying which sentence I am intending to annotate to make sure there is no confusion, because the website kept showing sentences other than the ones I was highlighting.

## Reflection Questions

### On your blog, reflect on any data cleaning you've had to do in other classes. Why don't historians discuss this kind of work? What gets hidden, what gets lost, how is the ultimate argument weaker as a result? Or does it matter? Make reference (or link to) key annotations, whether by you or one of your peers, to support your points.

I haven't had to do any data cleaning for other classes, so I cannot answer these questions from personal experience. However, I imagine historians don't discuss this because it seems more like a tedious task that everyone has to do before getting to more interesting work. Or, if they do discuss it, it would be to complain about something like how much time it's taking. However, I think it could be important to discuss the process of data cleaning because, otherwise, you might miss out on helpful or interesting information. I think that discussing data cleaning can go hand-in-hand with open notebook practices in the sense that you may assume some information is wrong and disregard it or delete it, when actually you interpreted it incorrectly, for example.
