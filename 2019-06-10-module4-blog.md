# Module 4 Blog

In feedback provided last week by Ruth, I learned that it is not mandatory to follow the 3 annotations format I have been using. So, I decided for this week that I would switch it up and write just a reflection on the reading I chose to do instead.

## Exercises

At the time of starting the exercises, I haven't yet decided what I want to do with the 14th Canadian General Hospital War Diaries for the Capstone Exercise. Because of this, I decided to do my 2 exercises with practice material instead, so I can see what might interest me, or what might be too difficult for me to try to do for the assignment.

### Exercise 2

I chose to try this topic modelling exercise because I had a really limited understanding of what topic modelling is, and I wanted to explore it, and see if it might be useful to me. 

## Reading Reflection

This week, I chose to annotate "Using Metadata to Find Paul Revere" by Kieran Healy. I really enjoyed reading this blog post because of Healy's decision to write in the voice of an 18th century scribe. It made his writing so much more engaging than many of the articles I've had to read throughout my university education. Healy's post was interesting to me because it provided an extra layer of understanding about how digital tools can be used by historians. We've explored so many different uses throughout this course, but we hadn't discussed how math (basic or not) can be useful to an historian and fit into this subject. Healy employed some math (which was way beyond my comprehension level) to analyze metadata about people's connections to organizations in the 18th century, to determine who was influential in the United States at that time. Not surprisingly, Paul Revere was singled out by the computer as a unique figure. Healy then used other equations to analyze the data in a variety of ways, to reveal more information on the subject. In this [annotation](https://hyp.is/ryqGHIexEembrMsyEBQQtw/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) I discuss how I had never before explored looking at tables, graphs, etc. in ways other than how the data is already laid out for me. I find this really intriguing, and it's something I look forward to learning more about and practicing, because I know that that skill could be very useful in conducting research. Healy's work in this blog post is a good example of the possibilities created by this technique. Furthermore, in this other [annotation](https://hyp.is/zQO_PofcEemrOM8Npm6YMQ/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) I reflected on how, even with the ability to look at a set of data in multiple ways, and the potential to reveal a great deal of information with this method, Healy points out that unless you have good metadata, this won't be possible. This technique can't make something out of nothing, but once you have a thorough set of data to base your work on, the technique can work to your advantage. 

While reading this post, [I also thought](https://hyp.is/YOEKCoe0Eem3eIMxeGZy4g/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) about how Healy's points can be used to think about how one might study today's society without invading people's privacy. Of course, for some topics of study that by nature require a closer look, this may not apply. But I drew on the example of targeted ads. Healy used various equations to get an idea of how specific 18th century people, such as Paul Revere, connected to each other and to various organizations. This can provide a great deal of information, such as insight into why someone became the leader of a political movement. In my annotation, I wondered whether this same idea can be applied to how companies produce targeted ads for consumers. I often feel as though this is done through invasions of my privacy, but perhaps it can be accomplished by looking at which stores' rewards card a person is signed up for, or something similar (though others' definitions of invasion of privacy may not agree with me). Though I am an historian of ancient Greek history, I think it's really interesting to think about how the things I'm learning in this course can be applied to life as I'm experiencing it, and I think it also helps me better understand the information I'm learning.
