# Module 4 Blog

In feedback provided last week by Ruth, I learned that it is not mandatory to follow the 3 annotations format I have been using. So, I decided for this week that I would switch it up and write just a reflection on the reading I chose to do instead.

## Reading Reflection

This week, I chose to annotate "Using Metadata to Find Paul Revere" by Kieran Healy. I really enjoyed reading this blog post because of Healy's decision to write in the voice of an 18th century scribe. It made his writing so much more engaging than many of the articles I've had to read throughout my university experience. Healy's post was interesting to me because it provided an extra layer of understanding about how digital tools can be used by historians. We've explored so many different uses throughout this course, but we hadn't discussed how math (basic or not) can be useful to an historian and fit into this subject. Healy employed some math, which was way beyond my comprehension level, to analyze metadata about people's connections to organizations in the 18th century, to determine who was a big player in the world at that time, in the United States. Not surprisingly, Paul Revere was singled out by the computer as a unique figure.
