# Module 4 Blog

In feedback provided last week by Ruth, I learned that it is not mandatory to follow the 3 annotations format I have been using. So, I decided for this week that I would switch it up and write just a reflection on the reading I chose to do instead.

## Exercises

At the time of starting the exercises, I haven't yet decided what I want to do with the 14th Canadian General Hospital War Diaries for the capstone exercise. Because of this, I decided to do my 2 exercises with practice material instead, so I can see what might interest me, or what might be too difficult for me to try to do for the assignment.

### Exercise 2

I chose to try this topic modelling exercise because I had a really limited understanding of what topic modelling is, and I wanted to explore it and see if it might be useful for the capstone exercise. After seeing the final product, I think it could be very helpful for getting started, so I will be using it. 

After downloading the Topic Modelling Tool, I didn't read the [Quickstart Guide](https://senderle.github.io/topic-modeling-tool/documentation/2017/01/06/quickstart.html) first, so I couldn't figure out how to upload the Colonial Newspaper Database document to the program. This confusion was only momentary though because I went looking for instructions, and learned that a folder must be uploaded, not a single file. I did this and received the correct output, according to the Guide. However, I had no idea what any of the output documents were trying to tell me. I went back to the Guide once more, and found a [link](http://miriamposner.com/blog/very-basic-strategies-for-interpreting-results-from-the-topic-modeling-tool/) to an explanation of how to make sense of the resulting documents. Miriam Posner's blog post helped me a lot because the main source of confusion was around how to figure out what topic those sets of words actually fall under. Posner explained that the user figures this out themselves, not the computer. Also, it's easier to figure this out when you're more familiar with the data, which explains why, even after learning this, I had a lot of trouble identifying the patterns. In addition, she mentioned that the user can arrange their data in different ways, such as individual documents for each week versus each year, to produce varied results that can reveal new patterns. I am glad I read her blog post because I think this tip will be useful for my analysis of the war diaries. Overall, this exercise went very well and was a good pick.

### Exercise 4

I chose to do this exercise as my second one because its description in the workbook, like that of Exercise 2, made it sound like a good starting point for my capstone exercise. I think it may help me get a sense of overarching ideas in the war diaries, so I can figure out a starting point for the assignment. Like the previous exercise, I used the Colonial Newspaper Database to do this. 

Once I had uploaded the file, I began to play around with the program to see what it could show me. Within the Word Cloud, I clicked on various words to see the results, and I also played around with erasing some of the words. Erasing didn't change much, but I can see how, if I was narrowing my results with a specific research goal in mind, this can be a helpful feature. Focusing on specific words in the Word Cloud produced some interested results. For example, I selected "may", and noticed that in the right-hand list of documents all uses of "may" were highlighted. This is a good thing to keep in mind, such as if I'm specifically looking for the month May, because this will cause the word frequency data to be wrong. I also like the tagging feature because it's a good way to keep track of which documents are relevant to your research goals. I tried tagging a few words I chose at random from the Word Cloud to see if I could locate documents to which all 3 tags applied, and there were many. This is a great feature for quickly eliminating documents that aren't useful to your project, especially when you may have hundreds of contenders. 

The Multisearch is also a useful tool. I explored the filter feature, which can be used to narrow down which documents are relevant to your research, in the same way that the tagging tool can. However, this tool is better for this purpose because it tells you how many documents fit your search and groups them all together on the right side of the page, so that they're all conveniently in one place. The tagging tool simply identifies which documents contain the relevant topics, but to find them you have to scroll through and look around. I can see Overview being a great tool for getting me started with the war diaries and I intend to use it.

## Reading Reflection

This week, I chose to annotate "Using Metadata to Find Paul Revere" by Kieran Healy. I really enjoyed reading this blog post because of Healy's decision to write in the voice of an 18th century scribe. It made his writing very engaging. Healy's post was interesting to me because it provided an extra layer of understanding about how digital tools can be used by historians. We've explored so many different uses throughout this course, but we hadn't discussed how math (basic or not) can be useful to an historian and fit into this subject. Healy employed some math to analyze metadata about people's connections to organizations in the 18th century, to determine who was influential in the United States at that time. Not surprisingly, Paul Revere was singled out by the computer as a unique figure. Healy then used other equations to analyze the data in a variety of ways, to reveal more information on the subject. In this [annotation](https://hyp.is/ryqGHIexEembrMsyEBQQtw/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) I discuss how I had never before explored looking at tables, graphs, etc. in ways other than how the data is already laid out for me. I find this really intriguing, and it's something I look forward to learning more about and practicing, because I know that that skill could be very useful in conducting research. Healy's work in this blog post is a good example of the possibilities created by this technique. Furthermore, in this other [annotation](https://hyp.is/zQO_PofcEemrOM8Npm6YMQ/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) I reflected on how, even with the ability to look at a set of data in multiple ways, and the potential to reveal a great deal of information with this method, Healy points out that unless you have good metadata, this won't be possible. This technique can't make something out of nothing, but once you have a thorough set of data to base your work on, the technique can work to your advantage. 

While reading this post, [I also thought](https://hyp.is/YOEKCoe0Eem3eIMxeGZy4g/kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) about how Healy's points can be used to think about how one might study today's society without invading people's privacy. Of course, for some topics of study that by nature require a closer look, this may not apply. But I drew on the example of targeted ads. Healy used various equations to get an idea of how specific 18th century people, such as Paul Revere, connected to each other and to various organizations. This can provide a great deal of information, such as insight into why someone became the leader of a political movement. In my annotation, I wondered whether this same idea can be applied to how companies produce targeted ads for consumers. I often feel as though this is done through invasions of my privacy, but perhaps it can be accomplished by looking at which stores' rewards card a person is signed up for, or something similar (though others' definitions of invasion of privacy may not agree with me). Though I am an historian of ancient Greek history, I think it's really interesting to think about how the things I'm learning in this course can be applied to life as I'm experiencing it, and I think it also helps me better understand the information I'm learning. 

## Reflection Questions

### Connections to Previous Classwork

Kieran Healy's post does not connect to anything I've done in my past classes. With the exception of this class, I've had almost no experience with digital history practices because my education has been based in quite traditional history. However, I have had the opportunity to use ORBIS, which is mentioned in "Principles of Information Visualization". I used ORBIS for an assignment on the Roman roads in first year, and I have also sometimes played around with it to see what interesting new information I might learn about travel in the ancient world.

### What could history be like if more of our materials went through these mills?

I think that, first and foremost, history as a practice could be more streamlined. If an historian were to look through hundreds of newspaper articles to find which ones contain information relevant to their research, this would take a very long time. Instead, they could upload these documents to a tool like Overview and quickly discover which ones contain the keywords they're looking for, and which ones they don't need to bother with. Furthermore, I think history could become a more accessible subject of study. Not everyone can learn efficiently by reading pages and pages of text alone, like we are often asked to do. Having charts and graphs and other visualizations, or even sonified information, can help people grasp more easily what they are learning. A good example of this is ORBIS. For me, trying to grasp the extent of the Roman roads and understand what travelling them must have been like just by reading a 200-page book was difficult. Then, I was introduced to ORBIS, and it made a huge difference for me.

### Who benefits from this kind of analysis? Who is hurt from this?
