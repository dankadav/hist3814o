# Module 4 Fail Log

## Exercise 2

Tip: you can save a link in Finder and it's the same thing as saving a document. Still worked with the topic modelling tool.

Used the [quickstart guide](https://senderle.github.io/topic-modeling-tool/documentation/2017/01/06/quickstart.html) for the tool, SUPER HELPFUL. Remember to use for capstone exercise 

Can put same folder as input and output directory, helps keep things neat.

An amazing resource for this: [link](http://miriamposner.com/blog/very-basic-strategies-for-interpreting-results-from-the-topic-modeling-tool/). Blog post to say how to interpret everything, remember for capstone exercise!!!!

## Exercise 4

Word Cloud > eraser button: removes words you don't need

Word Cloud > click on word > tags > give name for tag and apply: organizes so you know what's useful

Multisearch > search something > set as filter > SUPER useful for narrowing search, remember this!!

NOTE: may vs. May - same spelling different meaning, _might mess up results_. Use filter feature in this case?? 

## Capstone Exercise

Spaces in file names is not a good idea. Dashes and underscores are safe!

Possible ideas:

1. Map movement of nursing sisters throughout first world war to discuss their importance or something?

2. Use matronâ€™s reports for something? Talk about leisure or injury or sickness of staff or something? --> best idea?

3. Or talk about hospital functioning, like bed capacity and staff fluctuations

Website problems: was a server issue. Not always a me problem. Remember that sometimes leaving it can help
