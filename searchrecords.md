#Search Records - Module 2 Exercise 1

In Epigraphic Database Heidelberg, I searched "artifex" and "agricola", meaning "author/artist" and "farmer".

And [here](https://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/suche?hd_nr=&land=&fo_antik=&fo_modern_fundstelle=&literatur=&dat_jahr_a=&dat_jahr_e=&hist_periode=&atext1=agricola&bool=AND&atext2=&sort=hd_nr&anzahl=20) is the link to my search results for agricola.

In CWGC, I searched by my last name (Davidovic) and learned that a man named Ludvik Davidovic had died on November 5, 1944 in WWII. 
He was 30 years old and served as a "vojin" in the Czechoslovakian army. According to Google Translate, vojin means private/soldier.
There was additional information about where he was buried, as well. 
I downloaded this information to my computer, in the form of a .csv file, with which I am not familiar. I was able to open it in the Numbers software that came with my Mac.
The link to my search results can be found [here](https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?lastName=Davidovic).
