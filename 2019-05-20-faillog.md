# Module 1 Fail Log

Due to DHBox failing several times, I don't have much in terms of notes of my commands. But, when I was having lots of trouble in some parts of exercise 4, I did take some of my own notes which I've included below.

## Exercise 1

Didn't know where the back-tick key is on my computer because it's a french keyboard so had to google it. Used this [website](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69820/typing-a-backtick-on-mac-os-x-snow-leopard)

Didn't know difference between word processor and plain text editor so googled that as well. Used this [website](https://adapaproject.org/overview-plain-text-editor-vs-word-processor/)

Used [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) cheat sheet to imbed first link

## Exercise 2

wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.2.1/pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd64.deb **NOT** wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.2.1/pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd.64.deb, be more careful
