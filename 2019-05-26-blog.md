# Module 2 Blog

This week did not go nearly as smoothly as last week did. I encountered many challenges with the exercises. I completed the first 3 with minimal difficulty, but I was not able to fully complete the last 3. ADD MORE INTRO

## Activities

### Exercise 1

The record of my searches in the 2 databases can be found in the file searchrecords.md. To give a brief summary here: In the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg, I searched "artifex" and "agricola". In the CWGC, I searched "Davidovic" and found a Czechoslovakian soldier named Ludvik Davidovic, to whom I have no relation. In the Nano file, I forgot to put a space between the "#" and my header title but after uploading it I noticed this error and it was an easy fix. The only real difficulty I encountered was not understanding what I was meant to write about my experience using the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg. I asked this in Slack and Dr. Graham provided helpful guidance.

### Exercise 2

I encountered no problems doing Exercise 2. Doing Ian Milligan's tutorial was straightforward, and I saved my commands in the file wgetdownload.md. The second part of the exercise was also easy to follow, and I saved those commands in wardiariesdownload.md. This second file also has the commands from wgetdownload.md at the beginning, because I didn't know how to clear my history. Only after I saved my history did I see alexeitipenko’s comment saying that the command "history -c" can clear it, so I will keep that in mind for the future.

### Exercise 3

I really enjoyed this exercise, and I'm definitely keeping in mind that this is an acceptable Capstone submission. The exercise did trip me up a bit, but I managed to figure it out. My first impression of the Recovered Histories Website is that it is a trustworthy source. It provides an in-depth look at issues surrounding slavery and presents works by a variety of authors with different backgrounds and opinions on the matter. Also, the site offers additional services, like background information and glossaries, and lists its project partners, which all add to its trustworthiness. 

When I opened the .txt file, it opened in TextEdit. This text editor hasn't be mentioned so far in this course, so I wasn't sure if it was an inferior program to the Dr. Graham recommended ones, but I gave it a try and I think it works just fine. The transcription process went smoothly, but at step 1 of encoding my transcription, I got confused. I misunderstood the instructions as requiring me to highlight my text like I would with a highlighter on paper. With TextEdit, I could only highlight this way if I converted the .txt file to a rich text file. So instead, I decided to download Sublime Text and see if it had this function, and it did not. After some Googling, I found out that highlighting isn't really something plain text editors do, so I turned to Slack to see if anyone knew what we were supposed to do. Dr. Graham explained that the instructions are just telling us to mark up the text, and I was able to keep going. 

I then encountered another confusing issue when I tried to use GeoHack for the coordinates of Hanover, Jamaica. I got the coordinates from Wikipedia (18.4098° N, 78.1336° W), but when I put them in, GeoHack was showing me a place in Asia. I decided to double check the coordinates, and found that other websites listed them as 18.4098° N, -78.1336° W. I added the minus sign and got the right result. The rest of the encoding went smoothly.
