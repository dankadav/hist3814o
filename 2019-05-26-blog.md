# Module 2 Blog

This week did not go nearly as smoothly as last week did. I encountered many challenges with the exercises. I completed the first 3 with minimal difficulty, but I was not able to fully complete the last 3. ADD MORE INTRO

## Activities

### Exercise 1

The record of my searches in the 2 databases can be found in the file searchrecords.md. To give a brief summary here: In the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg, I searched "artifex" and "agricola". In the CWGC, I searched "Davidovic" and found a Czechoslovakian soldier named Ludvik Davidovic, to whom I have no relation. In the Nano file, I forgot to put a space between the "#" and my header title but after uploading it I noticed this error and it was an easy fix. The only real difficulty I encountered was not understanding what I was meant to write about my experience using the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg. I asked this in Slack and Dr. Graham provided helpful guidance.

### Exercise 2

I encountered no problems doing Exercise 2. Doing Ian Milligan's tutorial was straightforward, and I saved my commands in the file wgetdownload.md. The second part of the exercise was also easy to follow, and I saved those commands in wardiariesdownload.md. This second file also has the commands from wgetdownload.md at the beginning, because I didn't know how to clear my history. Only after I saved my history did I see alexeitipenkoâ€™s comment saying that the command "history -c" can clear it, so I will keep that in mind for the future.

### Exercise 3

This exercise tripped me up a bit, but I managed to figure it out.
