# Module 2 Blog

This week did not go nearly as smoothly as last week did. I encountered many challenges with the exercises. I completed the first 3 with minimal difficulty, but I was not able to fully complete the last 3. ADD MORE INTRO

## Activities

### Exercise 1

The record of my searches in the 2 databases can be found in the file searchrecords.md. To give a brief summary here: In the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg, I searched "artifex" and "agricola". In the CWGC, I searched "Davidovic" and found a Czechoslovakian soldier named Ludvik Davidovic, to whom I have no relation. In the Nano file, I forgot to put a space between the "#" and my header title but after uploading it I noticed this error and it was an easy fix. The only real difficulty I encountered was not understanding what I was meant to write about my experience using the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg. I asked this in Slack and Dr. Graham provided helpful guidance.

### Exercise 2

I encountered no problems doing Exercise 2. Doing Ian Milligan's tutorial was straightforward, and I saved my commands in the file wgetdownload.md. The second part of the exercise was also easy to follow, and I saved those commands in wardiariesdownload.md. This second file also has the commands from wgetdownload.md at the beginning, because I didn't know how to clear my history. Only after I saved my history did I see alexeitipenkoâ€™s comment saying that the command "history -c" can clear it, so I will keep that in mind for the future.

### Exercise 3

I really enjoyed this exercise, and I'm definitely keeping in mind that this is an acceptable Capstone submission. The exercise did trip me up a bit, but I managed to figure it out. My first impression of the Recovered Histories Website is that it is a trustworthy source. It provides an in-depth look at issues surrounding slavery and presents works by a variety of authors with different backgrounds and opinions on the matter. Also, the site offers additional services, like background information and glossaries, and lists its project partners, which all add to its trustworthiness. 

When I opened the .txt file, it opened in TextEdit. This text editor hasn't be mentioned so far in this course, so I wasn't sure if it was any good, but I gave it a try and I think it works just fine. The transcription process went smoothly, but at step 1 of encoding my transcription, I got confused. I misunderstood the instructions as requiring me to highlight my text like I would with a highlighter on paper. With TextEdit, I could only highlight this way if I converted the .txt file to a rich text file. So instead, I decided to download Sublime Text and see if it had this function, and it did not. After some Googling, I found out that highlighting isn't really something plain text editors do, so I turned to Slack to see if anyone knew what we were supposed to do. Dr. Graham explained that the instructions are just telling us to mark up the text, and I was able to keep going. 

The rest of the encoding went smoothly. Once I had finished, I had to figure out how to convert the .txt document to .xml. There was no Save As option, but there was an arrow at the top of the window beside the file name which gave me the option to rename the file. I wasn't sure if it also allowed me to convert it, but I decided to erase the .txt part of the name and write .xml. When I did this, I got a pop-up in Finder asking if I wanted to convert the file, so I clicked OK and it worked. I put the .xml and .xsl documents on my desktop, opened the .xml in Firefox, and got an error message. It showed me the problem sentence so I went back to TextEdit and realized I had forgotten an equals sign. I fixed it, saved it, and retried. I got this error a few more times again, and it was because I had copied and pasted that same line missing the equals sign a few times throughout the text. After fixing these problems, I was only getting plain text in Firefox. I carefully read every line and found no errors. My text hadn't automatically lined up with the indent of the <body> tag (it was all left aligned, with the exception of the first line), so I thought maybe that was the problem and indented every line. This only created big spaces in my sentences and caused another error message to pop up. I then tried just indenting the <p> lines so they were all aligned with the <body> tag but this didn't change anything. Finally, I reread the instructions and realized the .xsl file was titled 000style.xsl but the one I was using was SG_transformer.xsl. I switched them out and it worked!
